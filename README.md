# Create recat app with no code split

### git clone githuburl...
### cd project folder
### npm install
### npm run build to get generate build
### find one main.js file in build/static/js
### so now you have only one file `\build\static\js\main.a1919f71.js` for your whole recat app which you use anywhere
